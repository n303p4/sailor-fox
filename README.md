**kitsuchan-bot** was a small, modular, command-oriented Discord bot written in `discord.py`,
with a focus on readable, portable, and easy to maintain code.

**sailor-fox** is a port of most of kitsuchan-bot
to the [sailor command framework](https://gitlab.com/n303p4/sailor), with some various bots
provided as examples.
In particular, it provides Discord and Twitch bots that may be of actual use.
sailor-fox is based on a client-server model that allows multiple chat clients to share a common
command handler server, and/or a single client to use multiple servers.

For instructions on how to use sailor-fox, refer to [the documentation](docs).
