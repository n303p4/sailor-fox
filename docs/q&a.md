# Q&A

# Why is the Discord client written for Node.js? Why not just use Python for everything?

The Python Discord library situation is very up in the air right now, otherwise I would've!
Once it's clear which libraries will be reputable and will stick around for the long term,
I will probably rewrite the Discord portion of the codebase in Python.

## Can I use sailor-fox for my project?

Sure! Just read over [`LICENSE.txt`](LICENSE.txt) for details - it's very short, I promise! I
don't like long licenses, and you probably don't, either.

## Can I request a feature?

I don't take requests, but I do try and listen to feedback! Feel free to submit any suggestions
you have under the issue tracker. I'll be sure to ask you questions if I have any, and if I reject
your ideas, I'll try to explain my reasons as best as I can.
